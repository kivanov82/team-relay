# The M1 end-to-end gate (docs/M1-SPEC.md §9), and the plugin side of the M2 scenarios
# (docs/M2-SPEC.md §6) when the relay serves them. The harness plays Claude Code sessions
# started with the channel, so every channel server it expects to read a stream gets
# TEAM_RELAY_CHANNEL=1 (there is no claude process for it to find); M1 scenario 8 runs a
# working session with TEAM_RELAY_CHANNEL=0 and checks it never reads or acknowledges a stream. Starts a throwaway Firestore emulator
# (Docker, 127.0.0.1:8682, container ma-fs-e2e), writes a throwaway team config for team
# "demo" (alice, bob, carol, each with a fresh random static token stored only as its
# SHA-256), starts the relay on a free 127.0.0.1 port with RELAY_AUTH_MODE=static, builds
# the plugin bundles, runs the e2e vitest suite, and tears everything down on any exit.
# The M2 scenarios (test/e2e/m2.test.ts) run only when the relay answers GET /v1/health and
# GET /v1/teams/demo/activity; otherwise they are skipped and this script says so. They
# include M4 (docs/M4-SPEC.md §2, §3): a permission request's `waiting` tool event shows on
# the activity feed and the next event for that tool follows it, and the answering channel's
# shared folder names come back in the directory.
#
# M5 and M6 (docs/M5-SPEC.md §8, docs/M6-SPEC.md §6): when relay/tests/fake_oauth_app.py is
# there, the relay is started through it instead (the same app, with a fake Google sign-in
# provider on the same 127.0.0.1 port; static tokens still work), the team file names alice
# as the seed owner and gives each member a synthetic Google email, and test/e2e/m5.test.ts
# runs when the relay answers GET /v1/login/start with 400: the whole sign-in through the real
# login tool (no arguments; RELAY_URL names the relay) with a stub browser, confirmed by the
# login_wait tool (and by the status event, in a channel session), streams with the
# stored credential, /team-relay:logout (dist/logout.js), an owner adding
# a member through the console server, the new member signing in and appearing in the
# directory, and removal refusing them within 30 s.
#
# M7 (docs/M7-SPEC.md §4): when the relay answers GET /v1/teams/demo/inbox/summary with 200,
# test/e2e/m7.test.ts runs: a question to a member whose answering session is not running
# produces the waiting notice in their channel working session (nothing reads their inbox
# meanwhile), and is delivered once when their answering session starts.
#
# M8 (docs/M8-SPEC.md §6): test/e2e/m8.test.ts always runs: bob's channel working session
# answers on its own from a throwaway folder, with test/fixtures/stub-claude.mjs standing in for
# the headless answerer (TEAM_RELAY_CLAUDE_BIN; no model is called). A question inside the
# folder is answered automatically; one that needs a read outside it, a flagged draft and a
# capability call each wait until bob approves them in an MCP elicitation dialog (played by the
# test's client); a lapse sends nothing. Each member runs with a config directory of its own (a
# computer of its own: the answering lock is per computer), and the other scenarios' working
# sessions do not answer automatically (TEAM_RELAY_AUTO_ANSWER=0).
# Extra arguments are passed to vitest. The tokens are never printed.
