"""FastAPI app (M1-SPEC §3).

``create_app(settings, store)`` builds the app; ``relay.app:app`` builds one from the
environment on first access (so importing this module has no side effects). Bodies are read
and validated by hand, after authentication, so the order of refusals is always
401 → 400 (on-behalf header) → 404 (other team) → 403/422/… and every refusal body is
``{"error", "detail"}``.

Who the caller is (M5-SPEC §3, §4; M6-SPEC §1):
- ``Bearer trc_…``: a device credential; its team and member, while the member is on that
  team's roster (and was added no later than the credential was minted).
  A credential that records the email it was minted through stops working as soon as the
  entry no longer holds that email (M6-SPEC §7.1; the removal also revokes it).
- any other bearer token: the verifier's principal. A delegate's principal (M3-SPEC §2)
  names the member it acts for in ``X-Relay-On-Behalf-Of``; a ``google:`` principal is the
  member of the URL's team whose roster entry holds the email, and when that email is bound
  to a Google ``sub`` (M6-SPEC §7.2) the ID token's ``sub`` must be it (an unbound email is
  bound to it on the first call to its own team); a ``token:sha256:`` principal
  (development) the member the team file names for the URL's team, while on the roster. A
  principal that is a member of another team but not this one gets ``404``; one that is a
  member of no team ``401`` (M6-SPEC §7.4). A delegate's token names the console's service
  account, not the member, so the delegate path has no ``sub`` to check.

A delegate may reach only the GET routes in DELEGATE_ROUTES, and with ``manage-roster`` the
roster mutations in ROSTER_MUTATIONS (the service then requires the member it names to be an
owner, as for anyone), and with ``manage-teams`` an owner's deletion of the team
(TEAM_MUTATIONS, M9-SPEC §7.7). A delegate with ``team: "*"`` (M9-SPEC §5) acts in the team
the URL names, for the member of that team its header's email is; a team that is not one and
a team the email is not a member of are the same ``404`` (M9-SPEC §7.3).

A roster entry that is only invited (M9-SPEC §7.2) is not a member anywhere here: it never
resolves a principal, a delegate's email or a credential.

Before the membership check (M9-SPEC §7.9), a principal not seen by this process as a member
of the URL's team in the last KNOWN_MEMBER_TTL counts one against a per-principal, per-minute
budget in the store (``non_member_requests_per_minute``); over it: ``429 rate_limited``.

Teams (M9-SPEC §1): a team the API created is a team while its record says so, read on every
request that names it, so a deleted team is refused (``404``) and its credentials stop
working (``401``) at once, on every instance.

The account routes (M9-SPEC §2, §4) name no team: ``GET /v1/me/teams``, ``POST /v1/teams``,
``POST /v1/me/invitations/{team}`` and ``/v1/admin/teams``. They take a Google identity only:
a Google ID token, or a delegate on behalf of an email (``manage-teams`` to create or to act
for an admin, ``manage-roster`` to answer an invitation); never a device credential (it is
bound to its team) or a static token. A delegate's creation carries
``X-Relay-Client-IP-Hash`` (M9-SPEC §7.6). Every admin audit entry says ``via`` and refused
admin actions are recorded (M9-SPEC §7.5).

The login pages (M5-SPEC §2) are unauthenticated and live under ``/v1/login``.
