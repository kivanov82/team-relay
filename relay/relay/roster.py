"""The roster (M6-SPEC §1): who is a member of which team, in the store.

- :class:`Roster` resolves an email to a member of one team from a per-team cache that is
  trusted for at most ROSTER_CACHE_TTL by the service clock and then validated by one small
  read of ``roster_version`` (a full reload only when the version moved). A change made
  through this process drops the team's entry at once; a change made by another instance
  lands here within ROSTER_CACHE_TTL. Before a team is first read, the team file's seed is
  upserted into its roster (once per process and team).
- The ``plan_*`` functions are the pure bodies of :meth:`Store.mutate_roster`: they check
  every invariant against the roster the transaction read (at least one owner; an email in
  at most one entry of the team; member ids ``^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{1,31}$`` and unique; at most
  50 members; 1..5 emails an entry, a seed-only token member excepted) and raise an
  :class:`ApiError` to write nothing.
- A removed member's id is **retired** for RETIRED_ID_LIFETIME, longer than any request and
  its messages can live: while retired, it can be given again only to someone holding one of
  the emails it had (the same person coming back). Otherwise a new person under an old id
  would read that id's inbox and requests.
- No identity handover by email (M6-SPEC §7.1): an owner adds an email only to their own
  entry; taking an email off anyone revokes, in the same transaction, every credential
  minted through it.
- Accounts are bound by Google ``sub`` (M6-SPEC §7.2): :func:`plan_bind` records, per roster
  email, the ``sub`` of the first account that signs in with it; a later sign-in with that
  email from another account is refused. Removing the email drops its binding.
- Invitations, not silent membership (M9-SPEC §7.2): an entry an owner adds is ``invited``
  until its person accepts it (:func:`plan_answer`); declining removes it. An invited entry
  grants nothing: :class:`TeamRoster` keeps it apart (``invited``), so every lookup that
  makes someone a member (by email, by id, the members, the roles) sees active entries only.
  Only active owners count as owners. Seed members are active from the start, and every
  entry stored before the status existed reads as active.
