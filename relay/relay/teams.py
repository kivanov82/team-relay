"""Teams anyone can create (M9-SPEC §1, §2, §4).

- The team file's teams are **seed teams**: always active, never deleted through the API
  (``409 seed_team``), resolved from the file as before. Every other team is a record in the
  store that the API created; it is a team while its record says ``active``.
- :meth:`Teams.active` answers "is this a team now" for a request: a seed team without a
  read, any other team with one fresh read of its record on every call, so a deleted team is
  refused on every instance at once (M9-SPEC §1).
- :meth:`Teams.create` checks the id (shape, reserved words, the file's ids), the name and
  the owner's member id, then creates the team in one store transaction that also enforces
  that the id is free (two concurrent creations: one wins, the other gets ``409``), the
  per-account limit of teams created and not deleted, and the per-account-per-day and
  per-IP-per-hour creation counters.
- :meth:`Teams.delete` marks the team deleted in one transaction (from then on no
  credential of it authenticates, no roster change or login for it writes, and its creator's
  slot is free), then removes its documents in bounded batches; a later call resumes. The
  id stays reserved for TEAM_ID_RESERVATION; before an id that was deleted is created again,
  whatever is still under it is removed (anything a request racing the deletion wrote).
- Corrections after the M9 security review (M9-SPEC §7): a file team never adopts a created
  team (:meth:`Teams.ensure_seed_records`, and the roster's seeding, refuse to start); a team
  is created only over an id with nothing stored under it; a taken, reserved or recently
  deleted id is one answer, ``409 team_id_unavailable``; a name equal to a file team's is
  refused (``409 team_name_unavailable``); every attempt counts against a per-account quota
  (:meth:`Teams.count_attempt`); the per-account limits key on the Google ``sub`` as well as
  the email; a delegate's creations count against the client address the console reports and
  against a per-delegate cap; invitations are listed and answered here
  (:meth:`Teams.invitations`, :meth:`Teams.answer_invitation`); an owner may delete a team
  they own; every admin audit entry says ``via`` and refused admin actions are recorded.
- Emails never appear in a log line or an audit entry: only their SHA-256.
